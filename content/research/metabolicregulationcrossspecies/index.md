summary: Metabolism is often considered as a constitutive "maintenance" function in the embryo. However, research from my laboratory has shown that the FGF signaling gradient in the PSM regulates the transcription of glycolytic enzymes, thereby establishing a glycolytic activity gradient in the posterior PSM12. We demonstrated that the cells in the posterior PSM, which exhibit high aerobic glycolytic activity, also show an inverted pH gradient compared to normal cells. Consequently, their metabolism closely resembles the Warburg metabolism observed in cancer cells. We showed that glycolytic activity regulates Wnt signaling via the regulation of intracellular pH, promoting the acetylation of Î²-catenin13. This work provides an example of crosstalk between cellular signaling and metabolism regulation in the embryo. Moreover, it demonstrates the remarkable conservation of metabolic strategies between embryonic and cancer cells.


abstract: 'For a given vertebrate species, the total number of vertebrae is precisely defined, while it varies widely from one species to another. How such precision is achieved during development remains unexplained. We have shown that, in vertebrates, the elongation of the axis gradually slows down, leading to a progressive shortening of the PSM and, ultimately, the cessation of segment formation14, 15. We have demonstrated that in snakes, the oscillations of the segmentation clock are much faster relative to the growth rate of the embryo compared to the chicken embryo. This results in a very large number of small somites and thus explains the very high number of vertebrae in these species14. Therefore, modifying the parameters that control the segmentation clock and the elongation rate of the axis can alter the total number of segments in the embryo and, consequently, the vertebral formula.'
