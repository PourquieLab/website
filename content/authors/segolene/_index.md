I’m a pediatric cardiologist with a research focus in cardiac embryology, aiming to understand the developmental mechanisms underlying congenital heart defects. In Olivier Pourquié’s lab, I study how somite asymmetry affects heart morphogenesis. I use mouse and chick models to study how the heart tube forms, and I also explore how these mechanisms are conserved in humans. My goal is to link developmental biology and clinical insight to improve our understanding and care of congenital heart disease.
