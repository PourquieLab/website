I am a postdoctoral researcher developing new strategies for cell-based therapies in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). My research has two main directions: first, I am working toward establishing humanized mouse models of DMD to evaluate the regenerative potential of cell therapies in vivo. Second, I aim to generate muscle stem cells that can evade immune rejection and persist long term after transplantation. To achieve these goals, I use human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), differentiate them into muscle stem cells in vitro, and graft them into mice. Outside the lab, I enjoy social dancing and playing chess.
