I am interested in how cells interact among each other to self-organize into complex and functional structures. As an undergraduate, I studied how the plant root apical meristem communicates with other plant tissues about nutrient availability, integrating this information to regulate root growth. During my PhD, I investigated how cells of the floral meristem transport auxin to create precisely positioned signaling maxima that guide floral organ initiation. Currently, as a postdoc, I am exploring how HOX genes mediate the recognition between spinal motoneurons and their muscle targets to form correct neuromuscular circuits, using in vitro human stem cell models. In my spare time, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and dragon boat racing.Â
